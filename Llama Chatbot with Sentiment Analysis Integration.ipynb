The chatbot utilizes the LLaMa model to detect user frustration or satisfaction, enabling it to adjust responses and provide optimal customer service. By understanding user emotions, the chatbot can offer tailored support to road commuters and major road users, addressing distress in their conversations.\n","\n","**The primary objective is to create an intelligent, empathetic, and proactive conversational agent capable of answering questions and addressing concerns related to road anomalies, such as potholes and speed bumps.** The sentiment analysis integration plays a crucial role in detecting user distress and triggering appropriate responses, such as apologies and assistance offers.\n","\n","The project's accuracy and scalability are ensured through rigorous testing and evaluation of the chatbot's performance. The model's ability to understand context, detect sentiment, and respond appropriately is continuously refined and optimized. Furthermore, the system's design allows for seamless integration into existing mobile applications, ensuring a smooth user experience and effortless scalability.\n","\n","In summary, this project combines cutting-edge natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and mobile technology to create an innovative customer support chatbot that understands and addresses the unique needs and emotions of road commuters and major road users."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":48485,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726820992849,"user":{"displayName":"Oluwabori Ige","userId":"10428546443062187235"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"rJ3jiDL0aiSG","outputId":"a430bed5-d314-4881-d503-7f0b9c16f029"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["  Installing build dependencies ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Getting requirements to build wheel ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Building wheel for transformers (pyproject.toml) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n"]}],"source":["!pip install -q accelerate protobuf sentencepiece torch git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers huggingface_hub"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":16915,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726821009746,"user":{"displayName":"Oluwabori Ige","userId":"10428546443062187235"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"Sp5Q8AHpbgMB"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import os\n","from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline\n","from huggingface_hub import login\n","import torch"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":38733,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726823744804,"user":{"displayName":"Oluwabori Ige","userId":"10428546443062187235"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"OtpsurctsJUz","outputId":"1a32b091-ead1-41d5-9df0-b7a72307a8db"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":463,"status":"ok","timestamp":1726823972234,"user":{"displayName":"Oluwabori Ige","userId":"10428546443062187235"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"QWVfFDaHbjPp","outputId":"05f9fdbb-ca4b-4d59-80c9-7779565b6ac9"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["The token has not been saved to the git credentials helper.
